Hi, I'm Simon Howard, aka **fraggle** or **fragglet**. I'm primarily known for stuff related to Doom
(see [the Doom Wiki](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Simon_Howard_(Fraggle)) and
[Doomworld](https://www.doomworld.com/22years/lifetime.php) for some more context), but I also
hack on other retro-computing things.
